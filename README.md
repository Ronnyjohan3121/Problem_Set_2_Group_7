# Some general reminders: 

- It is essential how you write up the document. Be sure to be organized and consistent in explaining your equations and findings. Make sure that there are no compilation errors.
- 
- Write understandable code, separating and commenting on each section. Coding, like in writing, style is critical for readability. If the code is well written, it should be self-contained. There is no need to write everything you did. I encourage you to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
